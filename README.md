## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

### Continued development

I mainly use tailwind css for my style but when I can't seem to figure out how to add variants so I can check if my custom attribute is set to a certain value. And depending on that value, set the style of a specific element. So, adding that would be great.

Also, I think it would be neat to display different error message depending on the error. Like for example if there's a number on the first or last name, the error would still be that that field cannot be empty even though its not, it just have unallowed characters in it.
